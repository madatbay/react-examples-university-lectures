# React Examples used in lectures

Respository of mine where I keep examples I used in university lectures.

## Get started

1. Clone repository.
2. `cd react-university-lecture-projects/`
3. Install dependencies and start project.
4. Change git branch to desired example.

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

> Project uses vite as react bundler
